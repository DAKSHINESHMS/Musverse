## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" >Git</a> is a distributed version control system used for software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, keeping track of changes and managing versions. It also enables users to revert changes and collaborate more effectively.



<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">NodeJs</a> is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it possible to create server-side applications with JavaScript. Node.js is fast, lightweight, and scalable, making it popular for building modern web applications.
